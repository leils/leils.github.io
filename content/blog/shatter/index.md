**Shatter** allows you all the anxiety of breaking your screen, with all the satisfaction of having done it on purpose.
This experiment algorithmically generates each crack, matching it in size to a pitched sound of glass breaking. The end result is a remarkably convincing simulation of glass shattering, despite the simplistic implementation.

Try it yourself [here](https://leiac.me/shatter-sim) (make sure your sound is on).
