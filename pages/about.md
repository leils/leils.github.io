##Leia Chang - Scatterbrain Extraordinaire

Hand me a cup of coffee with a dash of cream, and let's get talking.

I'm a fourth year student at Cal Poly SLO, studying Computer Science. I'm fascinated with tech that's meant to interact with society and daily life. Currently, I'm focused on working front-end and figuring out ways of mashing dance and tech together in a new way. 

I'm always up for a chat, so [get in touch](mailto:e.leiachang@gmail.com).
