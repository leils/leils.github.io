A first assignment for ITP's Hypercinema class; a sound walk. I collaborated
with classmates \_\_\_\_ Yujung and Cat Dinh to create this piece; a meandering journey through
what it sounds like to come home. The piece joins each of the creators as we
return home at the end of the day, gather ourselves a meal, and finally sit down
to enjoy it. At times it may be clear which house is which; at others, they seem
to blend together.

While creating a sound walk seems easy enough, this proved surprisingly
difficult. I'm grateful for my limited experience with film and recording; it
may have been many years ago, but some basics hold; understanding the need for
silence, how close the microphones need to be held to the source of the sound,
the instinct to do three or four (or more!) takes.

A few lessons learned from this adventure;

- It is remarkably difficult to match sound quality if different people are doing
  the recording
- While Audition is incredibly powerful, you inherently lose some amount of data by
  de-noising your audio
- Record good sound to begin with (editing is hard)
- Sometimes, larger SD cards can make your life harder (looking at you, Zoom recorders)
- Storytelling requires attention to detail that varies per-medium. Sound has its
  own intricacies.
