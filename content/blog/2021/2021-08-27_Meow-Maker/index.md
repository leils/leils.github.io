# Meow Master
Earlier this month I moved across the country to attend NYU ITP, the Interactive Telecommunications Program. This has meant leaving a darling, snuggly cat behind in San Francisco (as well as my dear partner, but that's beside the point). 

To make missing this fuzzy friend a little easier, I made a little timer to simulate her constant need for food. 

*[insert gif here]*

It all started here: ![Picture of a paper cutout in the silhouette of a cat head and jaw, over sketches of a cat head that opens/closes its jaw](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sketch-blog-857c6.appspot.com/o/cat-timer%2FE2B92FE4-0BCE-4A84-889F-A5C7CDB08EF6.jpg?alt=media&token=42a09256-3804-4575-a60f-c5a85ffac8e0)

I wanted this piece to: 
1. Be **physically interactive** 
2. Run **mechanically**, not digitally 
3. Have a sense of **whimsy** (which is ... uh ... hard to quantify) 

A couple of desired interactions: 
- The audience gets to  "push down" the nose to reset the timer 
- The timer "yells" when it's "hungry"

I spent a month learning a bit about 3d printing, using **OnShape** to create the CAD elements, and a **Prusa3d** to print. These are some pretty basic shapes, but they had to be modeled to fit the pre-existing parts on the timer itself. 

![Image of a timer, the dial is a cat head in profile. The cat faces to the right, its mouth is closed.](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sketch-blog-857c6.appspot.com/o/6F4FA6E9-6104-440B-B7A3-837555684355.jpg?alt=media&token=1ceef497-88f0-4c7f-ae3d-f09b7a9f736b)
In order to "feed" the cat, you push the nose down, effectively closing the cat's mouth. 
30 minutes later, the cat "yells" for more food.
