<p>In a moment of command-blindness today, I managed to delete my entire repo of developing projects. No harm, of course - they were all git repos, and backed up on the internet. Simple matter of going to BitBucket and re-cloning, right? So first things first - grab my last project, re-clone it, get back to working in no time.
Except when I tried to re-compile, it failed. At 5%. Looking like this.</p>

<p>How the hell was I not finding ‘OpenGL/gl.h’?
I still don’t know quite what I did, but it only took 20 minutes for me to go from rendering collision-detecting dogs to not being able to compile squat.</p>

<p>Two hours, a half dozen fix attempts, and many StackOverflow tabs later, I get to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18647976/missing-opengl-headers-on-mac">this: Missing OpenGL Headers on Mac</a>, which linked to yet another StackOverflow question … It turns out that even if you have Xcode installed, Command Line Tools doesn’t come with it anymore. Which means the headers I was looking for didn’t even exist at this point.
Bully.</p>

<p>At least the fix was easy. A TLDR:
Run “xcode-select –install”.</p>

<p>And now we’re all back up and running!
How did I somehow remove my Command Line Tools and OpenGL headers? Still no idea.
Tips for future me, dealing with weird compile failures:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Keep scrolling. If you’re lucky, someone else who had the same problem has commented recently on that 6-year-old thread with an updated answer.</li>
  <li>Version control might not keep everything perfect, but it’ll get you back to working without weeks of sleepless nights.</li>
  <li>OS’s do some pretty weird things.</li>
</ol>
