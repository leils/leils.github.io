title: And So It Begins 
---

That's right, I made about the simplest personal website in existence. 

Why? Well, first of all there's a lot to be said about the use of personal websites for self promotion. It feels like in order to be competitive, you've got to have a suave, minimalist business card, a beefed-up portolio, and a pretty website to go along with it. 

But in the end, this is a place for me to play around with some web design, see how far I can push GitHub Pages and Jekyll in my experiments. This page might change a lot, and it's all in good fun. Let's see if I can hook up a sweet Flickr slideshow embed, or figure out how the heck paginator works. 

For anyone else interested in playing around with this, here's some stuff to start out with: 

- [JekyllRB Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
- [Github Pages Basics](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)
